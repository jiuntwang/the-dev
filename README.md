# The Dev - A Text Adventure Game

### About
The project utilizes Node.js as a development platform that runs Javascript outside of the browser. Using Bower and Grunt, we use Yeoman (an application built on the Node.js platform) as a templating tool. The Yeoman process allows the project to bootstrapped easily and quickly. 

The Flickr API was incorporated to allow a gallery of images to be displayed on the project, and will automatically be populated when images are added to the gallery on my Flickr account. This allows me to pull images from an external source, and have the images saved and hosted on their site.

A Twitter feed was embedded into the project by displaying any tweets with the hashtag "WATSthedev" for users to share tips, commens, and questions. An alternative form to a comment section to allow an easy flow of conversation.

This project this a work in progress, and the other pages in the navigation are not created yet. 

### Notes
This text adventure game is created by Jiun Wang, for Seattle University's Web Development Capstone project.
